            <h2>
                Home Page- Main Topic Our home page will be the first thing that people will see when exploring the company. 
                Here they will find pictures showing what we do and also some text describing what we do. We want to make this look as appealing as possible, so we will be choosing images that will explain what we do in a way words cannot. 
                We also are focusing on professionalism s which is one of our companyâ€™s main selling points. At the bottom footer, we will have easy, transparent, and accessible contact information. Our goal for the home page is to attract, so therefore we will only use very professional images that will portray a sense of the service type we offer. 
                The layout will also need to be organized so that it gives the professional feel that we desire. This will mean that we will have a moderate amount of material on our home page. In addition, the head will be an easy-to-navigate field that allows the customer to quickly choose to either learn more about our staff and us or be directed to the booking page where they will get a general sense of how to make an appointment.
