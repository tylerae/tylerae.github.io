        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Home Page- Main Topic
	      Our home page will be the first thing that people will see when exploring the company. Here they will find pictures showing what we do and also some text describing what we do. We want to make this look as appealing as possible, so we will be choosing images that will explain what we do in a way words cannot. 
        We also are focusing on professionalism s which is one of our companyâ€™s main selling points.  At the bottom footer, we will have easy, transparent, and accessible contact information. 
        Our goal for the home page is to attract, so therefore we will only use very professional images that will portray a sense of the service type we offer. The layout will also need to be organized so that it gives the professional feel that we desire. 
        This will mean that we will have a moderate amount of material on our home page. 
        In addition, the head will be an easy-to-navigate field that allows the customer to quickly choose to either learn more about our staff and us or be directed to the booking page where they will get a general sense of how to make an appointment. 

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="images/community-pool.jpg" alt="image for homepage" width="200px" height="200px">

      </ul>
      <h3>[About Us]</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the first subpage for our website. 
        This is where our prospective new customers will come to read about who we are and what we do. 
        This will be vital to attracting new customers. 
        They will read how we bring professionalism to everything we do and possibly info on our staff. 
        They are very professional staff, and we will include a picture and bio of the ones we would like to highlight. 
        This way, the customers will get a sense of who will access their property to clean their pool. 
        One problem that many people face when selecting a company or induvial to provide pool cleaning services is that they fear choosing someone who turns out not to be trustworthy or professional. 
        The preparation aspect of this ensures that it is effective in maintaining a professional staff. 
        This may also include paying them more than other induvial would.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        This page 3 is very different from the contact us option in the footer because it allows customers to book directly through the website.
        Typically, when people hire a pool guy, someone with a calendar simply tells them what time he may come. Our site will allow people to see how we operate in terms of our cleaning time and how they can create appointments online. 
        This is also a part of the professional business model because not many pool cleaning services can have such a website and make appointments online. In addition to providing a way to make appointments inline, there will also be information on how booking works, how the appointments are weekly, and how they can adjust who the employee comes to clean their pool. 
        We have also thought of adding pricing information for new customers and also a breakdown of the cost. We can also include plan types and what is included in each one. This will reinforce our professionalism and allow us to make adjustments to our marketing strategy. We may have a premium service option to better market to the higher-class homeowners.
